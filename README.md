# `kubegen` â€“ simple way to describe Kubernetes resources

Kubernetes resource definitions are too verbose, and there is no built-in framework for reusability.
Writing good resource templates is hard, whether you are rolling your own or using Helm.

***The aim of this project is to make it easier to write reusable Kubernetes resource definitions.***
The project should be useful as is, but it's ambition is to drive the community towards an improvement
upstream. However, please note that it is ***WORK IN PROGRESS*** rigth now.


<!--

There is no clear answer to re-usability and de-duplication for Kubernetes resource definitions.

The aim of `kubegen` is to offer the community with a few different options, and we will decide later
which one is level of abstraction is best, or if there is a need for abstractions at different levels.

## Service/Deployment pair based on container image

```
kg component-from-image

## CLI Usage

You can generate a simple app with just one flag, the image name:
```
kubegen single --image "errordeveloper/foo:latest"
```

This will geneate app named `foo`, but if you'd like to call it something else,
you can pass `--name` flag.

By default, a `Deployment`/`Service` pair is generated with a number of known-best-practice
options included for you, e.g. liveness and readiness probes as well as Prometheus annotations.
You can change this behaviour by using high-lvel `--flavor` flag or one of more specific flags
described below.
