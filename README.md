# `kubegen` â€“ generate Kubernetes resources from simple app definitions

## CLI Usage

You can generate a simple app with just one flag, the image name:
```
kubegen single --image "errordeveloper/foo:latest"
```

This will geneate app named `foo`, but if you'd like to call it something else,
you can pass `--name` flag.

By default, a `Deployment`/`Service` pair is generated with a number of known-best-practice
options included for you, e.g. liveness and readiness probes as well as Prometheus annotations.
You can change this behaviour by using high-lvel `--flavor` flag or one of more specific flags
described below.
